# Akshat Kumar's Portfolio

Hi! My name is Akshat Kumar and I am a student 👨‍🎓 at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

Since I started participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition 🤖 in ninth grade, I have been obsessed with enginering and design, specifically mechanical engineering.

Within mechanical engineering, I'm especially interested in CAD 👨‍💻 and manufacturing. I also love automotive engineering and aerodynamics, primarily due to watching F1 🏎.

Besides engineering, I am interested in technology 💻 and play a lot of cricket 🏏 and football 🏈.
